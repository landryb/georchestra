OpacitySlider ADDON
===================

This addon allows users to manage background layers into mapfishapp. A slider between 2 combo box
of opaque layers allows the user to switch the transparency between 2 bases layers. It also restrict the use
of the manageLayers panel to behave more like a fully integrated background layers panel.
